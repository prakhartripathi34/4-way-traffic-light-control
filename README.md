# Traffic Light Control
  
This repository contains the Verilog code for a traffic light controller system designed for a 4-way intersection. The project includes the implementation of the traffic light controller module and a testbench for simulation and verification.

   <font size="+2">Overview</font>
 
The traffic light controller manages traffic lights for different paths at a 4-way intersection:

Left Path

Right Path

Straight Path

Back Path

The controller transitions between different states, each representing a different traffic light configuration, ensuring smooth and safe traffic flow.

State-Based Traffic Light Control: Implements a state machine to control traffic lights based on predefined timing parameters.

Simulation Testbench: 

Includes a testbench for simulating and verifying the behavior of the traffic light controller.
